			<h1>What is Coronavirus ?</h1>
			<p>A coronavirus is a kind of common virus that causes an infection in your nose, sinuses, or upper throat.
				Most coronaviruses aren't dangerous.
				<br><br>
				In early 2020, after a December 2019 outbreak in China, the World Health Organization identified
				SARS-CoV-2 as a new type of coronavirus. The outbreak quickly spread around the world.
				<br><br>
				COVID-19 is a disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 that can trigger what doctors call a respiratory tract
				infection. It can affect your upper respiratory tract (sinuses, nose, and throat) or lower respiratory
				tract (windpipe and lungs).
				<br><br>
				It spreads the same way other coronaviruses do, mainly through person-to-person contact. Infections
				range from mild to deadly.
				<br><br>
				SARS-CoV-2 is one of seven types of coronavirus, including the ones that cause severe diseases like
				Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and sudden acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The other
				coronaviruses cause most of the colds that affect us during the year but arenâ€™t a serious threat for
				otherwise healthy people.
